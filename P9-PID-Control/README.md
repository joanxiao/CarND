## PID Controller
A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time.

The proportional term (Kp) is proportional to cross-track error (CTE) and determines how fast the car will turn. Increasing Kp enables the car to better follow sharp turns. However, if Kp is too large, the car will begin to oscillate around (overshoot) the target trajectory and the car will be unstable and may even leave the track.

The integral term (Ki) is proportional to both the magnitude of the CTE and the duration of the CTE. It can be used to correct system bias, e.g., generated by wind or systematic error in the steering system.

The diffenrential term (Kd) is proportional to the rate of change of the CTE. It damps the oscillation behavior caused by Kp and therefore increases the stability of the car.

## Tuning the parameters Kp, Ki and Kd

I chose to tune the parameters manually:
1. Let the car drive in the simulator with all three parameters set to 0. The car quickly drives off the track. At the beginning the CTE is about 1. So I initialized the p_error to be 1.0 in the PID controller.
2. I then increase Kp until the car oscillates a bit, and then I increase Kd until the car is stable. I've left Ki to be zero as there seems to be no system bias in the simulator.
3. The parameters I settled on are: (0.3, 0.0, 20.0), with a constant throttle 0.3. The car drives at around 25 MPH. Below is a video at the beginning of the track.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) == 0.13, but the master branch will probably work just fine
  * Follow the instructions in the [uWebSockets README](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/blob/master/README.md) to get setup for your platform. You can download the zip of the appropriate version from the [releases page](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/releases). Here's a link to the [v0.13 zip](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/archive/v0.13.0.zip).
  * If you run OSX and have homebrew installed you can just run the ./install-mac.sh script to install this
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/releases) in the classroom.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.

## Windows Install Instructions

1. Install, in your root `c:/` directory, vcpkg https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg   (15 - 30 minutes)
2. Be sure while installing vcpkg to carefully follow all instructions! This is NOT an easy install process.
3. Install python 2.7 (dependency for libuv)
4. cd to directory with vcpkg .exe and `./vcpkg install uWebsockets` (20 min, mostly automatic)
5. Open CMakeSetting.json, check if `C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` is the correct directory to your vcpkg and `DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` matches the output from vcpkg integrate.
6. Open in VS17 community edition, build pid.exe in x86 debug.


## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
